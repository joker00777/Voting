# About the Project

GOT-Voting is an online Voting platform to vote your favourite game of thrones house which is built using etherium blockchain technology.The web application uses solidity smart contracts for its back-end logic and web3js API with react for it's front end.

**The site is live on https://got-voting.web.app/ **


Only the owner of the smart contracts have the ability to add new houses.

One voter can vote once and he or she can't take back their votes becuase smart contracts are immutable.Once a transaction is done it can't be roll backed.

#Usage
One of the most important factors of voting is security. Currently, voting systems are very open to hacks. Without substantial security mechanisms in place, malicious actors can enter the system and alter the outcome. This is where blockchain comes in. The technology has the ability to introduce a seemingly unhackable system.
All votes could be verified as soon as voting is finished to ensure they are all counted correctly. Without blockchain, this would have to be done by a central body overseeing the process. This causes many questions to arise about the trust of these central bodies. But with blockchain and its decentralised ledger system, there is no need for a potentially fallible or corruptible central body.
